# okotu-npc-ai-engine

Paper/Spigot plugin that connects Citizens-managed NPCs to an Ollama docking
service and gives them layered, persistent memory: a stable character sheet,
per-player relationship/memory that compresses itself over time, shared
village-wide events, per-NPC knowledge boundaries, and a lightweight
emotional state - all folded into a compact prompt (roughly 300-500 tokens,
workable even on a 1-1.5B model).

## Status

This is a **functionally complete skeleton** (follows current Paper/Citizens/
Ollama APIs), but it has **not been built with Maven in the environment that
generated it** (no network access, and no JDK/`javac` either - only a JRE -
in that sandbox). Before going to production:

1. `mvn clean package` locally and fix any compile nits.
2. Double-check the versions in `pom.xml` against what's currently published.
3. Test on a development server before going live.

## Versioning

The jar filename always embeds the Maven version (`<finalName>` in `pom.xml`
uses `${project.artifactId}-${project.version}`), e.g.
`okotu-npc-ai-engine-1.08.jar`. `plugin.yml`'s `version:` field is filled in
automatically at build time from the same value, so **the only place you
need to bump the version for a new release is `pom.xml`**.

## What's new in 1.08

- **Bug fix: memory compression timing out.** Console showed
  `Error checking/compressing memory for npc=X player=Y` /
  `HttpTimeoutException: request timed out` from `SummaryService`. Cause:
  the single `ollama.timeout-ms` (8s by default) was applied to *every*
  Ollama call, including memory-compression summaries - but those generate
  up to `summary-num-predict` (400) tokens instead of the short
  `num-predict` (64) used for normal dialogue, so they legitimately take
  longer and were getting cut off by a timeout tuned for quick replies.
  `OllamaClient.chat()` now takes an explicit timeout per call; dialogue
  keeps using `ollama.timeout-ms` (8s default) while summarization uses a
  new, separate `ollama.summary-timeout-ms` (30s default). If you still see
  timeouts from `SummaryService` after upgrading (e.g. on a slow CPU-only
  box), raise `summary-timeout-ms` further, or lower `summary-num-predict`
  / `conversation.summary-max-words` so there's simply less to generate.

## What's new in 1.07

- **Bug fix: replies weren't reaching Ollama at all on some Paper setups.**
  The NPC would greet first via proximity just fine (that part doesn't
  depend on chat), but typing a reply did nothing - no error, no request
  sent, nothing. Root cause: `NpcBridgeListener` only listened for the
  legacy `org.bukkit.event.player.AsyncPlayerChatEvent`. Paper reworked its
  chat pipeline around 1.19.1 in favor of the Adventure-Component-based
  `io.papermc.paper.event.player.AsyncChatEvent`; depending on the server
  and what other chat-related plugins are installed, the legacy event can
  simply never fire, so the plugin never saw the player's message at all -
  the conversation session opened correctly, it just never got consumed.
  `NpcBridgeListener` now listens for **both** event types and funnels them
  through the same handler. If a server happens to fire both for the same
  physical message, only the first one does anything (the session gets
  cleared as soon as it's consumed, so the second one finds nothing to do) -
  no duplicate requests to Ollama, no double relationship/summary updates.
  No config changes needed, this just works better after upgrading the jar.

## What's new in 1.06

- **AI chat is now opt-in per NPC.** Every Citizens NPC used to gain a random
  personality and start talking automatically the moment a player
  clicked/approached it - fine for a village of speaking villagers, less
  fine if you also have decorative, quest, or vendor NPCs from other systems
  that should stay silent. `npc_profiles` has a new `enabled` column
  (defaults to `0`/false); `NpcBridgeListener` and `ProximityGreetingTask`
  both now check `EnabledNpcRegistry.isEnabled(npcId)` - a fast in-memory
  lookup, not a database query - before doing anything at all for an NPC. A
  disabled NPC is completely inert to this plugin: right-click passes
  through untouched (for whatever other plugin wants it) and it's skipped
  entirely by the proximity scan.
- **`/okotunpc enable <npcId>`** turns AI chat on for an NPC - creates its
  character sheet (via the same random-profile pools as before) if it
  doesn't have one yet, or just flips the flag back on if it was previously
  disabled (keeping whatever backstory/knowledge/relationships it already
  had). **`/okotunpc disable <npcId>`** turns it back off without deleting
  any of that data. Both take a plain numeric NPC id and work identically
  from the server console or in-game - no dependency on Citizens' own
  in-game "selected NPC" concept, which doesn't exist for a console sender.
- **`/okotunpc version`** prints the running plugin version plus every
  AI-related parameter currently loaded (Ollama address, model, keep-alive,
  num-predict, temperature, timeouts/retries, conversation/summary/
  relationship/interaction settings, count of AI-enabled NPCs) - and
  deliberately **never** any `mysql-*` setting (host, port, database,
  username, password, table-prefix). It's meant to be safe to run in front
  of other people or paste into a support channel. Needs no database access,
  so it answers instantly even from console.

## What's new in 1.05

- **Proximity-based conversations, NPC greets first.** Right-click used to be
  the only way to start talking to an NPC - which breaks badly if another
  plugin on your server hijacks right-clicking an NPC/entity for something
  else (the reported case: a "climb on NPC's shoulders" plugin, so right-click
  mounts the player before Citizens/this plugin ever sees the interaction).
  As of 1.05, a new `ProximityGreetingTask` runs on the main thread every
  `interaction.proximity.check-interval-ticks` and, for every spawned
  Citizens NPC, checks for players within `interaction.proximity.radius`
  blocks. The first time a given (NPC, player) pair gets close enough
  (subject to `interaction.proximity.greet-cooldown-minutes` so standing
  there doesn't repeatedly re-trigger it), **the NPC speaks first** - a
  genuine AI-generated, in-character greeting that's aware of relationship
  score and compressed memory (a returning player with a good relationship
  gets greeted by name; a stranger gets a generic hello), not a canned
  string. Right-click still works alongside it by default - set
  `interaction.right-click.enabled: false` in config.yml if it keeps
  conflicting with the other plugin and you want proximity to be the only
  way in.
- **Shared session tracking.** Whichever way a conversation starts (click or
  proximity), it's now tracked by a single `ConversationSessionManager`
  instead of right-click's own private map, so the two triggers never
  fight over "is this player mid-conversation right now". Its timeout
  (`interaction.chat-capture-timeout-seconds`, default 30) also moved out of
  hardcoded Java into config.yml.
- **Unprompted greetings fail silently.** If Ollama doesn't answer in time
  for a proximity greeting, the player just doesn't get greeted (logged at
  FINE, not shown as an error) - unlike a real question they asked, there's
  nothing to apologize for since they didn't ask anything. The conversation
  session still opens either way, so they can just start typing to the NPC
  even if the auto-greeting itself didn't come through.

## What's new in 1.04

- **Faster requests to Ollama.** Every `/api/chat` call now also sends
  `keep_alive` (keeps the model loaded in RAM between requests - avoids a
  slow reload on the next message), and an `options` object with
  `num_predict` (hard cap on how many tokens a reply can generate - the
  single biggest lever for response speed, since NPC replies are meant to be
  short anyway) and `temperature`. All three are configurable under
  `ollama:` in `config.yml` (`keep-alive`, `num-predict`, `temperature`).
  `stream` stays hardcoded to `false` in the code (not exposed as a config
  option) since the plugin always needs the full reply at once.
  - **Important detail**: `num-predict` (default 64) is deliberately
    **not** applied to `SummaryService`'s memory-compression calls - a
    64-token cap would chop a ~200-word summary off mid-sentence.
    `OllamaClient.chat()` now has a second overload taking an explicit
    `num_predict`, and summarization uses its own
    `ollama.summary-num-predict` (default 400). If you raise
    `conversation.summary-max-words` a lot, raise `summary-num-predict`
    to match or summaries will get truncated.
- **No more per-NPC model override.** `npc_profiles.model` is gone. Every
  NPC now uses whatever `ollama.default-model` is configured in
  `config.yml` - change that one value (e.g. to `"gemma3:1b"`) to switch
  every NPC's model at once. If you're upgrading from 1.02/1.03 and had
  per-NPC overrides set, see `sql/MIGRATION_1.03_TO_1.04.sql` - it shows you
  which NPCs had a custom model *before* dropping the column, since that
  information has nowhere left to go.
- **Default fallback text, reworded.** You flagged the same "Neutral,
  curious about newcomers... / An inhabitant of this world..." text again in
  English form - it was already translated in 1.03 (see "About the old
  default text" below for where it actually comes from and why you should
  essentially never see it in practice). Reworded it once more here just to
  make it visibly different from the 1.03 wording, in case you were
  comparing the two builds side by side.

## What's new in 1.03

- **Full English translation.** Every player-facing and NPC-facing string is
  now in English: the prompt sections (`SYSTEM`/`MEMORY`/`KNOWLEDGE`/`CONTEXT`),
  the auto-built character sheet text, fallback messages, chat-capture
  messages, relationship descriptors, the memory-compression instruction sent
  to Ollama, error messages, log lines. **This includes the instruction that
  tells the NPC what language to answer in** - it used to say "answer in
  Italian", it now says "answer in English", so out of the box NPCs will now
  reply in English instead of Italian. If your playerbase is Italian-speaking
  and you only wanted the *code/config* in English, edit the one line in
  `PromptBuilder.buildCharacterSection()` (`"Answer in English, briefly..."`)
  back to Italian, or better, make it a `config.yml` setting - happy to wire
  that up if you'd rather it be configurable than hardcoded either way.
- **Randomized starter profiles.** The first time a player ever talks to a
  given NPC, `RandomProfileGenerator` now picks a role/personality/
  background/profession/speech-style independently at random from the pools
  under `npc-defaults` in `config.yml`, instead of every new NPC getting the
  exact same placeholder text (see "About the old default text" below).
  Village and per-NPC model are deliberately never randomized - see the
  comment in `RandomProfileGenerator`.
- **Default model reconfirmed as `qwen2.5:1.5b`** in both `config.yml`
  (`ollama.default-model`) and the built-in fallback in `PluginConfig` used
  if that key is ever missing from config.yml.
- **Ollama communication debug logging.** New `debug.log-ollama-communication`
  in `config.yml` (off by default). When `true`, `OllamaClient` logs the full
  JSON request sent to Ollama and the raw response received, to the server
  console at INFO level, prefixed `[Ollama DEBUG]`. Very useful while tuning
  prompts/personalities, but noisy and logs conversation content - leave it
  off in normal production use.

### About the old default text ("Neutral, curious about newcomers...")

You asked where that came from: it's `NpcProfile.defaultFor()`, a hardcoded
fallback in the Java code (`model/NpcProfile.java`) - every NPC that didn't
have a row in `npc_profiles` yet fell back to that exact same static text
when a conversation started, which is why every new NPC looked identical.
That method still exists (now translated to English) but as of 1.03 it's
only used as a last-resort fallback if the database is unreachable when a
conversation starts - the actual first-conversation path now goes through
`RandomProfileGenerator` instead, described above.

## What was new in 1.02

A full memory redesign, replacing 1.01's single `npc_character` /
`npc_conversation_log` pair with six tables:

| Table                 | Purpose                                                         | Changes how often |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| `npc_profiles`         | Character sheet (name, role, personality, background, village, profession, speech style, per-NPC model override) | Rarely |
| `npc_player_memory`    | Relationship score + compressed long-term summary per (NPC, player) | Every ~30 messages |
| `npc_dialog_history`   | Raw recent turns only (compressed away periodically)             | Every message, but self-trimming |
| `village_events`       | Shared memory across every NPC in a village, with priority + expiry | As events happen |
| `npc_knowledge`        | Topic -> fact pairs; an NPC only talks about what's listed here  | Rarely |
| `npc_state`            | Emotional state (happiness/fear/anger/fatigue/hunger), 0-100     | Occasionally |

### Memory compression, the core new mechanic

Every `conversation.summary-trigger-messages` (default 30) raw messages
accumulated for a given (NPC, player) pair, `SummaryService` asks Ollama to
fold them - plus the existing summary, if any - into an updated summary
capped at `conversation.summary-max-words` (default 200) words, saves it to
`npc_player_memory.summary`, and deletes the raw rows from
`npc_dialog_history`. This is what keeps long-term memory small no matter how
long a player has been talking to an NPC. The "ULTIMI MESSAGGI" section of
the prompt is unaffected by this - it always shows the last
`conversation.recent-messages` (default 20) raw turns, tracked independently.

### Prompt structure

`PromptBuilder` assembles, in order: **SYSTEM** (character sheet - or the
`system_prompt` column verbatim if you've authored one by hand), **MEMORIA**
(relationship + compressed summary + notes for this player), **CONOSCENZA**
(the NPC's `npc_knowledge` entries - explicitly instructed to admit not
knowing things outside this list), **CONTESTO** (active `village_events` for
the NPC's village + a short mood description derived from `npc_state`). The
recent raw messages are passed separately as chat history to Ollama's
`/api/chat`, not flattened into the system prompt text.

### Dynamic relationships

`npc_player_memory.relationship_score` (-100..100, clamped) drives the
MEMORIA section's tone description. Adjust it via:
- `/okotunpc relationship <npcId> <player> <delta>` (raw number), or
- `/okotunpc relationship <npcId> <player> action:<key>` using a named delta
  from `relationship.actions` in `config.yml` (e.g. `action:saved-villager`), or
- the public API (`OkotuNpcApi#adjustRelationship` / `#applyRelationshipAction`)
  from another plugin - e.g. hook it into your economy/quest/combat events.

### Ollama docking: prod vs test, same as MySQL

Each profile block (`prod:` / `test:`) in `config.yml` now carries **both**
the MySQL connection **and** the Ollama docking address (`ollama-host` /
`ollama-port`), selected together by the same `active-profile` switch (or
`-Dokotu.profile=test`). This lets you point test traffic at a separate,
disposable Ollama instance if you want.

```

## Setup

### 1. Database(s)

`okotu_npc_ai` (prod) and `okotu_npc_ai_test` (test), same as 1.01. Provision
with `sql/okotu_npc_ai.sql` / `sql/okotu_npc_ai_test.sql`, or just let the
plugin create the tables automatically on first startup - either way the
databases themselves must already exist with a user that has privileges:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS okotu_npc_ai      CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS okotu_npc_ai_test CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'usr'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'psw';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON okotu_npc_ai.*      TO 'usr'@'%';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON okotu_npc_ai_test.* TO 'usr'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

### 2. Choosing prod vs test

Same mechanism as 1.01, now covering Ollama too:

```yaml
active-profile: "prod"   # or "test"
```

Override without editing the file via `-Dokotu.profile=test` on server
startup (wins over the config value). Switching requires a restart or
`/okotunpc reload` - it doesn't hot-swap an already-open connection mid-session.

### 3. Build

```bash
mvn clean package
```

### 4. First run

If `plugins/OkotuNpcAiEngine/config.yml` doesn't exist yet, the plugin
creates it from the bundled default on startup. Edit it, then
`/okotunpc reload`.

> **About `plugin.yml`**: it's a **build-time** manifest packaged inside the
> jar (it's what tells Bukkit/Paper the plugin exists at all), so it can't be
> "created at runtime" by the plugin itself. If a built jar is missing it,
> that's a packaging issue - see Troubleshooting below.

## In-game usage

**An NPC only responds if an admin has enabled it first** with
`/okotunpc enable <npcId>` (see "What's new in 1.06") - a freshly-placed
Citizens NPC stays silent until then.

Two ways to start talking to an enabled NPC (both on by default, see
`interaction:` in config.yml):

- **Proximity** (new in 1.05): walk within `interaction.proximity.radius`
  blocks of a Citizens NPC - it notices you and greets you first.
- **Right-click**: click the NPC, it invites you to type. Disable via
  `interaction.right-click.enabled: false` if another plugin on your server
  hijacks right-clicking NPCs/entities for something else (see "What's new
  in 1.05").

Either way, the plugin then listens for your next chat message
(`interaction.chat-capture-timeout-seconds`, default 30s), sends it to
Ollama with the assembled prompt, and the reply appears prefixed with the
NPC's name. On timeout/error, a random `fallback.messages` entry is used and
the conversation isn't lost.

## Commands (permission `okotu.npcai.admin`, default op)

- `/okotunpc reload`
- `/okotunpc profile <npcId> <field> <value...>` - fields: `name`, `role`,
  `personality`, `background`, `village`, `profession`, `speech_style`,
  `knowledge`, `system_prompt` (no `model` field since 1.04 - see "What's new
  in 1.04")
- `/okotunpc knowledge add <npcId> <topic> <text...>` /
  `/okotunpc knowledge remove <npcId> <topic>`
- `/okotunpc event add <village> <priority> <expiresHours|never> <summary...>` /
  `/okotunpc event remove <eventId>`
- `/okotunpc relationship <npcId> <player> <delta>` or
  `/okotunpc relationship <npcId> <player> action:<key>`
- `/okotunpc state <npcId> <happiness|fear|anger|fatigue|hunger> <0-100>`
- `/okotunpc enable <npcId>` / `/okotunpc disable <npcId>` - turns AI chat on/off
  for an NPC (console-friendly, see "What's new in 1.06")
- `/okotunpc version` - running version + AI parameters only, never MySQL settings
- `/okotunpc info <npcId> [player]`

## Public API for other plugins

`OkotuNpcApi`, registered as a Bukkit service:

```java
RegisteredServiceProvider<OkotuNpcApi> rsp =
        Bukkit.getServicesManager().getRegistration(OkotuNpcApi.class);
if (rsp != null) {
    OkotuNpcApi api = rsp.getProvider();
    api.applyRelationshipAction(npcId, playerUuid, "saved-villager");
    api.addVillageEvent("Oak", 5, "Gli zombie hanno distrutto il ponte.",
            Instant.now().plus(3, ChronoUnit.DAYS));
}
```

All methods are async (`CompletableFuture`) and safe to call from the main
thread.

## Troubleshooting

- **Plugin doesn't load / `plugin.yml` seems missing from the jar**: run
  `unzip -l target/okotu-npc-ai-engine-1.08.jar | grep plugin.yml` after
  building. A stale `target/` from a partial build can cause this - try
  `mvn clean package` from scratch.
- **MySQL connection errors on startup**: check `active-profile` matches a
  section present in `config.yml`, and that the account has privileges on
  the configured database.
- **Memory never compresses / `npc_dialog_history` keeps growing**: check
  the console for `SummaryService` warnings - this almost always means
  Ollama is unreachable or timing out. The safety cleanup job
  (`conversation.max-raw-messages-safety`, default 90) will hard-cap the
  table in the meantime so it can't grow unbounded, but compression will
  keep retrying every turn until Ollama answers.

## Known limitations / suggested next steps

- **Chat capture** listens to both the legacy `AsyncPlayerChatEvent` and
  Paper's `AsyncChatEvent` since 1.07 (see "What's new in 1.07") for broad
  compatibility across server/plugin setups.
- **One active conversation per player** at a time (last NPC that either
  greeted them by proximity or that they clicked).
- **Proximity scan cost**: `ProximityGreetingTask` is O(spawned NPCs x
  online players in that NPC's world) every `check-interval-ticks`. Fine for
  typical village-sized NPC counts; if you have hundreds of NPCs and
  players, raise the interval or consider bucketing by chunk/region instead
  of scanning every NPC every time.
- **`npc_state` moods are generic** (tired/afraid/angry/hungry/happy), not
  target-specific ("angry at the mayor" needs a free-text mechanism like
  `notes` or a `village_events` entry - the numeric state alone can't express *who*).
- **Multi-node failover**: `OllamaClient` still points at a single
  `base-url` per profile; if you run multiple dockings, it'll need node
  selection logic.
- **Summary quality depends on the model**: with very small models (1-1.5B),
  double check compressed summaries occasionally - consider using a larger
  `ollama.summary-model` than your dialogue model if quality matters more
  than compression latency (summarization runs in the background, off the
  player's critical path, so it can afford a slower/bigger model).

## Migrating from 1.05 to 1.06

**Real schema change, and a real behaviour change** - read this before
upgrading a server with existing NPCs that are already talking.

1. Start the plugin once on 1.06 against your existing database (same
   `active-profile`). This creates the new tables/columns it needs
   automatically where they're missing, but `enabled` on `npc_profiles`
   needs an explicit `ALTER TABLE` since the table already exists - the
   automatic `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` won't add a column to an existing
   table.
2. Run `sql/MIGRATION_1.05_TO_1.06.sql`. It adds the `enabled` column
   (default `0`).
3. **Every NPC that was already talking under 1.05 will go silent** the
   moment that column lands, because it defaults to disabled. Either:
   - re-enable them one at a time as needed: `/okotunpc enable <npcId>`, or
   - uncomment the bulk `UPDATE npc_profiles SET enabled = 1;` line at the
     bottom of the migration script to flip every existing NPC back on at
     once, preserving the "everything talks" behaviour from 1.05 and
     earlier.
4. Going forward, any newly placed Citizens NPC stays silent until you
   explicitly run `/okotunpc enable <npcId>` for it - there's no config
   toggle to bring back "every NPC talks automatically" as the default,
   this is intentionally opt-in now.

## Migrating from 1.02/1.03 to 1.04

A genuine (small) schema change this time - a real `ALTER TABLE`, not a rename:

1. Update to 1.04 and start the plugin once against your existing database -
   the new schema (without the `model` column) only affects newly-created
   installs; on an existing database the plugin does **not** drop the column
   for you (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` never touches existing tables).
2. Run `sql/MIGRATION_1.03_TO_1.04.sql`: it first shows you which NPCs (if
   any) had a custom per-NPC model set, then drops the `model` column. Review
   that list before running the `ALTER TABLE` - once the column is gone,
   there's no record of which NPCs used to have a different model.
3. From then on, every NPC uses `ollama.default-model` from `config.yml`.

If you're using a non-empty `mysql-table-prefix`, adjust the table name in
the migration script accordingly.

## Migrating from 1.01 to 1.02

**This is a real data migration, not just a rename** (unlike 1.0.0 -> 1.01).
`npc_character` -> `npc_profiles` splits/renames columns, and
`npc_conversation_log` -> `npc_dialog_history` renames `ruolo`/`messaggio` to
`speaker`/`message`. Four brand-new tables have no 1.01 equivalent.

Steps:

1. Update to 1.02 and start the plugin once against your existing database
   (with the same `active-profile` pointing at your current data) - this
   creates the new tables (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`) alongside the old
   1.01 ones, without touching your existing data.
2. Run `sql/MIGRATION_1.01_TO_1.02.sql` against that database. It:
   - copies `npc_character` -> `npc_profiles` (mapping `nome` -> `name`,
     `personalita` -> `personality`, `backstory` -> `background`; `role`,
     `village`, `profession`, `speech_style` come across empty/NULL since
     1.01 never captured them - fill them in afterwards with
     `/okotunpc profile ...`);
   - copies `npc_conversation_log` -> `npc_dialog_history` (straight column
     rename, same data);
   - seeds `npc_player_memory` with `last_seen` inferred from the migrated
     dialog history (relationship score starts at the configured default,
     since 1.01 never tracked it);
   - gives every migrated NPC a default `npc_state` row.
3. Review the migrated data, then **manually** drop the old 1.01 tables
   (commented out at the bottom of the migration script, not run
   automatically):
   ```sql
   DROP TABLE npc_conversation_log;
   DROP TABLE npc_character;
   ```

If you're using a non-empty `mysql-table-prefix`, adjust every table name in
the migration script accordingly before running it.
